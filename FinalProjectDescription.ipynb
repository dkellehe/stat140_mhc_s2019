    "# Final Project\n",
    "###  Stat 140 - Intro to Statistics - Spring 2019\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations, you have made it to the end of the semester, and this is the final project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will consist of a short 10 minutes presentation and a jupyter notebook documenting the code that you used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project goals\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast with the midterm project, the goal for the final project is to use the article as a starting point, and to create a presentation which is based on something that interested you about the data or the subject of the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Content of the presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Your presentation should \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Summarize the article\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the hypotheses and results?\n",
    "\n",
    "- How are graphs/data/visualisations used to support these?\n",
    "\n",
    "2) What questions did you have after reading the article?\n",
    "\n",
    "3) How did you use statistics and data to investigate these questions?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your investigation should have 2 visualisations, at least one should be advanced (i.e. involve regression or confidence intervals) and at least one should come from a secondary/outside datasource.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Timeline \n",
    "\n",
    "April 11 - Start Date\n",
    "\n",
    "April 16 - Submit proposal (this is an article, an outside data source, and a preliminary list of questions)\n",
    "\n",
    "April 25 - Writing Clinic - (In class discussion of your project)\n",
    "\n",
    "April 26 - Rough Draft due\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "April 30 - Presentations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Suggested Articles\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reason these are suggested is that the data involved (for the most part) is not specific to the article, so you can use it as a secondary source.\n",
