labs and assignments from Introduction to the Ideas of Statistics, spring 2019.

There were two types of online homework assignments... the ones called `ProblemSets` and the ones called `ReadingQuiz`. Problem sets were based on the conceptual material in class broken into units which revolved around EDA, inferential statistics, and regression. Reading quizzes were to be taken after "reading" datacamp courses or online articles or other videos. The reading quizzes were designed to evaluate how well one aquired knowledge from these outside sources, and were primarily focussed on learning R.

There are also the midterm and final projects. These had students reading and evaluating data-based articles, with the side goals of getting them to learn to use github, import data and cleaning it. My organizing principle for this semester's version of the course was data literacy, so that is why I had the focus on data journalism be their final evaluation.
